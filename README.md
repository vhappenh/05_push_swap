# push_swap

"Push_swap" is a project focusing on sorting data on a stack with a limited set of instructions, aiming to achieve the lowest possible number of actions. 
Students must manipulate various algorithms to choose the most suitable solution for optimized data sorting. 
The project involves creating a C program called push_swap that calculates and displays the smallest program, composed of Push_swap language instructions, to sort integers received as arguments. 
The main objectives include learning about sorting algorithms, their complexity, and developing skills in C programming and basic algorithms. 
The project follows common instructions such as adherence to the Norm, proper memory management, and Makefile requirements.
